    <h1>About Me</h1> <hr>
    <h2>Hi! I'm Alejandra Uranga, I'm 32 years old and I'm from Mexico. </h2>

    <p> I'm single mom and I love it. 
        I like movies, books, music.. I love to travel.
        <br> I really like cats, I have one cat, it's name is Osito beb√©. 
        <br> Since I was a little girl, about 4 years old, my grandpa teached me how to use PC's, and that's where my love for technology came from.
